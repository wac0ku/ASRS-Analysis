2023-01-15,B737,cruise,"During cruise flight at FL350 we experienced an engine vibration warning on engine #1. The vibration levels increased gradually and we decided to shut down the engine as a precautionary measure. We declared an emergency and diverted to the nearest suitable airport.","Engine vibration warning during cruise, emergency shutdown","Engine vibration, emergency diversion"
2023-02-20,A320,takeoff,"On takeoff roll at approximately 80 knots we heard a loud bang from the left engine followed by a loss of power. We aborted the takeoff and returned to the gate. Maintenance found a compressor blade failure.","Engine failure during takeoff roll","Compressor blade failure, aborted takeoff"
2023-03-10,B777,climb,"During initial climb we received an engine fire warning for engine #2. We followed the engine fire checklist and shut down the engine. The fire warning extinguished after pulling the fire handle.","Engine fire warning during climb","Engine fire, emergency checklist followed"
2023-04-05,A330,descent,"On descent we noticed fluctuating EGT readings on engine #1. The temperatures were cycling between normal and high ranges. We reduced power and monitored the situation closely.","Fluctuating EGT readings on descent","Engine temperature anomaly"
2023-05-12,B737,approach,"During approach we experienced a sudden loss of thrust on engine #2. We were able to maintain control and landed safely on the remaining engine. Post-flight inspection revealed a fuel system malfunction.","Sudden thrust loss on approach","Fuel system malfunction, single engine landing"
2023-06-18,E190,taxi,"While taxiing to the gate after landing we heard unusual noises from the right engine. We shut down the engine immediately and requested a tow to the gate.","Unusual engine noises during taxi","Engine noise, precautionary shutdown"
2023-07-22,A320,cruise,"At cruise altitude we received multiple engine warnings including low oil pressure and high oil temperature on engine #1. We declared an emergency and diverted.","Multiple engine warnings at cruise","Oil system problems, emergency diversion"
2023-08-30,B737,landing,"During landing rollout the left engine began surging and producing black smoke. We evacuated the aircraft as a precaution after clearing the runway.","Engine surge and smoke on landing","Engine surge, smoke, evacuation"
2023-09-14,A330,climb,"Shortly after takeoff we experienced engine stall on engine #2. We followed the engine stall recovery procedure and were able to restart the engine.","Engine stall after takeoff","Engine stall, successful restart"
2023-10-25,B777,cruise,"During cruise we noticed decreasing fuel flow to engine #1 despite normal throttle settings. We monitored the situation and landed at our destination without incident.","Decreasing fuel flow during cruise","Fuel flow anomaly"
2023-11-08,A320,takeoff,"On takeoff we experienced engine failure at V1. We continued the takeoff and climbed on one engine. We declared an emergency and returned for landing.","Engine failure at V1","Engine failure, continued takeoff"
2023-12-03,B737,maintenance,"During routine maintenance inspection a crack was discovered in the engine fan blade. The blade was replaced and the engine was tested before return to service.","Fan blade crack found during maintenance","Fan blade crack, maintenance action"
2024-01-17,E175,cruise,"We experienced intermittent engine power fluctuations during cruise. The autopilot disconnected several times due to the power variations.","Power fluctuations during cruise","Engine power instability"
2024-02-28,A330,descent,"On descent we received an engine overheat warning. We reduced power and followed the overheat checklist. The warning cleared after power reduction.","Engine overheat warning on descent","Engine overheat, checklist followed"
2024-03-15,B737,approach,"During final approach we lost all engine indications on the EICAS display. We continued the approach using backup instruments and landed safely.","Lost engine indications on approach","Display system failure"
